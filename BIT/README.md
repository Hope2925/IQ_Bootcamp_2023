# BioFrontiers IT

BIT is the superhero team that runs Fiji, the supercomputer Cluster resource, among many other things. Below are some key tips to help navigate FIJI w/ help from BIT. I can assure you from personal experience that they are all extremely nice and very hardworking. You never need to doubt that they are doing their best. :) 

## What do I do when something isn't working on Fiji?
1. See if you can figure it out by looking up tips online or asking colleagues.
	- Depending on what BIT is dealing with on a given day, responses to help tickets might take longer than you'd like. And many times solutions can be found on google or by asking a colleague. *Note*: if a solution involves using sudo or changing key settings, don't do it without consulting BIT as you can make the problem worse.
	- Make sure to keep good notes on what you try. You will be very grateful for this later when something like it happens again, it happens to another person, and for the ticket submission if it still doesn't work (see below)
2. Submit a ticket
	- You can submit a ticket either by clicking [this link](https://bit.colorado.edu/contact/#submit-a-ticket) or by emailing fiji-help@colorado.edu for FIJI based questions or bit-help@Colorado.EDU for BIT specific questions. I prefer the email method to more easily send images. 
	- Look at the next question to get info on what to include in the ticket.

## What should I include in a help ticket to BIT?
1. A hello (remember that these are people so saying a quick "Hi" is nice)
2. Name of your PI (if not in a lab yet, include the PI you're currently working with)
3. Clear description of what the problem is, the exact code you ran to produce the problem, and the error you're getting. Showing an image or putting the EXACT error message you're receiving is very helpful. Try to include as much of the error message as possible (you can highlight what you think is most important but seeing everything can really help).
4. Clear code of what you've tried so far to solve the problem
	- Sometimes trying to solve things can help a bit and/or make new problems. Therefore indicating exactly what you did can be very informative.
5. A thank you and/or have a great day!
