### Connecting Git & Github Demo

1. Open a Github repository
- You can create your own or use a current one.
2. **Clone** the repository onto your local machine
  - This 'downloads' it onto your personal machine. The term clone is used because it should be identical.
  - Click on the green button that says “<> Code”. Click the https version
